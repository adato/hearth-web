	<h2>Hearth.net T&amp;Cs in a nutshell</h2>
	<h3>Behave responsibly and enjoy</h3>
	<p>Before creating a profile, read the terms and conditions in full. You know the deal: you can click, but you have to read.</p>
	<h4>Who we are</h4>
	<p>Hearth.net is a website run by Adato Paradigma. We aim to spread generosity in real life and that’s why we maintain this site. It’s where you, our users, exchange gifts and fulfill your wishes. From small to big things, services or skills. 
	</p>
	<h4>A gift is… a gift</h4>
	<p>
	Everything revolves around gifts here. We are not eBay, a job portal, nor a classifieds server. Everything takes place selflessly, without any claims or expectations from the giver. The ultimate goal is always joy. Joy that you can pass on to the rest of the world.
	</p>

	<h4>Look who’s talking</h4>
	<p>Mutual trust and transparency are key for us. Communicate here as you would in real life. Give honest feedback under your name, with a personal photo and complete profile. Don’t forget we’re on the internet – and the whole wide world is your audience. 
	</p>

	<h4>What goes around…</h4>
	<p>At Hearth.net the same rules and laws apply as in every state with a legal system. Any breach will always bear consequences. And one more thing. We care about human decency and kindness. Don’t be afraid to speak to anyone mistreating you. Even a negative rating can help when it is polite.</p>

	<h4>Why do we do it</h4>
	<p>For the pure joy of it! To make our world better, bit by bit. It’s not about gifts, it’s about giving.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Quite clear, don’t you think? But you should still check out our T&amp;Cs in full. Reading it will be a breeze now.</p>
